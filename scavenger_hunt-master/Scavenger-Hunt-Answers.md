## Scavenger Hunt

Welcome to the Lighthouse Labs Scavenger Hunt! This game is designed to test your creativity, your ability to traverse directories in a Unix/Linux environment, and your ability to build skills with some shell commands such as `find` and `grep`. 

There are many layers of nested directories before you. The goal of this exercise is to locate a few surprises that have been left for you throughout the directories. All of these have a logical pattern, and all of them are engineered to help you learn how to maneuver around in the shell.

## Points!

Give yourself 10 points for every one of these you can find:

1. A speech from Pulp Fiction

2. A reference to bacon (Tip: Sandwiches are yummy.)

scavenger_hunt-master/b/l/t/bacon.txt

3. Cheesy feet (no, not your neighbour's!)

4. Quotes from a time traveler

8. beer and cider in the same place

9. collard greens

Give yourself 5 points for doing the following:
1. cd to a directory tree that spells out the common name for a canine

cd ./d/o/g

2. From #1, cd DIRECTLY to another directory that spells out the common name for a feline

cd ../../../c/a/t

3. From #2, cd DIRECTLY to another directory that spells out the name of the bald (and very cool) instructor

cd /vagrant/scavenger_hunt-master/d/o/n

4. From the top level directory, cd to a directory level that spells out 'top'.

cd t/o/p

Alright, if you found everything, and did it all correctly, you should have 110 points total and a lot more experience moving around in a Unix/Linux directory environment.
